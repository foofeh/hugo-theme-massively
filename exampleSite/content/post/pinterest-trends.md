The <a href="https://trends.pinterest.com/?country=US">Pinterest Trends</a> tool was released in late 2019 by Pinterest. Pinterest Trends allows you to see what search terms are currently trending on Pinterest. 
<br>
Pinterest Trends is also perfect for doing keyword research. Using the search function, you can start to plan your Pinterest content strategy to stay engaging and relevant with your audience.
<br>
In this cheatsheet, I will be walking through how to use the new Pinterest Trends Tool.

<center><i>Above is the Pinterest Trends homepage.</i></center>
<br>
On the homepage of Pinterest Trends is what search terms are currently trending on Pinterest. 

The first panel, <i><b>Today's Top Pinterest Trends</i></b>, provides a high-level glance at keywords with large increases in searches. The keywords here are overarching and span across multiple categories.

As you scroll down, Pinterest breaks out the popular search terms by popular categories: <i>Fashion</i>, <i>Food & Drink</i>, <i>Beauty</i>, and <i>Home</i>.

This information is great for a high-level of what is trendy on Pinterest. Should you have a different topic you want to get search volume for, this is where the search bar comes in handy.

<center><h2>Pinterest Keyword Research: Getting Started<h2></center>
I run <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/bakersspotlight/">BakersSpotlight</a>, a baker's community, on Pinterest. Planning out my content strategy, I want to get keyword search volume reports specific to baking.

 <center><i>The search function is great for quickly seeing Pinterest search volume for new keywords.</i></center>
<br>
Starting with <i>"cake decorating"</i>, Pinterest auto-suggests keyword ideas based of what you typed in.
<br>
On the right-hand side of each keyword is a search volume over time graph. 
<br>
Using the search bar is a great way to quickly get new keyword ideas and see keyword performance at a glance.
<br>
Clicking on a keyword takes you to a new screen for a deeper-dive.
<br>

<br>
The main part of the Pinterest Trends tool is an interactive graph. Providing data from the last 12 months, each data point is from a period over a week. 

Pinterest does not provide the actual number of searches for that particular keyword. Instead, they compare the search volume of your keyword to all other searches during that week. Then, Pinterest indexes that number from 0 to 100 to compare the relative search volume of each term.

In other words, the search volume number is comparing search volume to other keywords in the same time period. The closest you get to 100 the more searches for that week there are.
<br>
<br>
<center><h3>Comparing Keywords</center></h3>
Being able to compare keywords enables you to plan out your content strategy better. 

Pinterest allows you to add up to 4 keywords to the interactive graph.

You can add keywords in in following ways:

<b>Related Terms</b>: Below the interactive graph are related terms Pinterest auto-suggests. Simply click on they keyword and it will be added to the graph.

<b>Search Bar</b> Going back up to the search bar, you can type in a new keyword. A list of suggestions based off of what you typed in will pop-up. Once you found the keyword you want, simply click on it to add to the graph.

Here is a perfect example of how to use the tool to plan out content strategy.

Around Christmas time, cake decorating stops getting as much searches. What takes it's place? Cookie decorating and royal icing.
<br>
Royal icing is a type of frosting that is often used for cookie decorating. Ever see one of those memorizing cookie decorating videos? Yup. They're using royal icing.
<br>
Cookies are incredibly popular around Christmas. Using this tool, I found I should switch my content from cakes to cookies around Christmas!

Launched in December 2019, Pinterest 100 is a visual way to explore what is trending on Pinterest.
The homepage has the top trend themes laid out visually, but to see all of the topics at once you can click the two vertical lines on the top left.
<br>
Pinterest considers a theme a trend if there was a search volume trajectory for at least six months.
The current 2020 report compares August 2017 - July 2018 to August 2018 - July 2019.
<br>
Partnering with WGSN, Pinterest identified keywords surrounding these trends broken down by country.
