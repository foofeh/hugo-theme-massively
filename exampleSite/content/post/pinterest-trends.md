The <a href="https://trends.pinterest.com/?country=US">Pinterest Trends</a> tool was released in late 2019 by Pinterest. Pinterest Trends allows you to see what search terms are currently trending on Pinterest. 
<br>
Pinterest Trends is also perfect for doing keyword research. Using the search function, you can start to plan your Pinterest content strategy. Keyword research is important to find new content opportunties and to stay engaging with your current audience. 
<br>
<br>
In this cheatsheet, I will be walking through how to use the new Pinterest Trends Tool.

<center><h2> Pinterest Trends Homepage </center></h2>

<center><i>Above is the Pinterest Trends homepage. You can see what is trending in popular categories.</i></center>
<br>
On the homepage of Pinterest Trends is a high-level report on what keywords are currently trending.

The first panel, <i><b>Today's Top Pinterest Trends</i></b>, shows keywords that had a recent surge in searches. The keywords here are overarching and span across multiple categories.

As you scroll down, Pinterest breaks out trending keywords by popular categories: <i>Fashion</i>, <i>Food & Drink</i>, <i>Beauty</i>, and <i>Home</i>.

This information is great for a high-level of what is trending on Pinterest. Should you have a different topic you want to get search volume for, the search bar comes in handy.
<br>
<br>
<center><h2>Pinterest Keyword Research: Getting Started<h2></center>
I run a baking community on Pinterest. I want to get keyword search volume reports specific to baking. Using this tool will help my plan out when I should feature cookie content vs cake content.

 <center><i>The search function is great for quickly seeing Pinterest search volume for new keywords.</i></center>
<br>
Using the search bar is a great way to quickly get new keyword ideas and see keyword performance at a glance.
<br>
<br>
 <b>Step 1:</b> Type in a keyword you would like to explore.
 <br>
 <b>Step 2: </b> Pinterest auto-suggests keyword ideas in the drop-down menu.
 <br>
 <b>Step 3:</b> In the right corner of every keyword is a search volume graph. This shows search volume for that keyword over the last 12 months. 
 <br>
 <b>Step 4:</b> Click on the keyword you want to explore. You will be navigated to a new page for a deeper-dive into search volume.
<br>
<br>
<center><h3> Keyword Deeper-Dive</center></h3>

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/PTOvertimeGraph.png" width="80%" height="80%"></center>
<Center><i> Hovering over the graph allows you to see search volume for each week. </center></i>
<br>
The main part of the Pinterest Trends tool is an interactive graph. Providing data from the last 12 months, each data point is from a period over a week. 

Important note: The search volume is not the <b><i>actual</b></i> search volume. Instead, Pinterest provides a score from 0-100 that is relative to other keyword searches during the same time period. The higher the search volume number, the more searches there are compared to other searches.
<br>
A search volume score of 90 has a lot more searches than a keyword with a score of 20. 
<br>
<center><h3>Comparing Keywords</center></h3>
Being able to compare keywords enables you to take your content strategy to the next level. Knowing <i>what</i> people are searching for <i>when</i> allows you to adjust content to hit on popular search windows.
<br>
<br>
<center><h3> How To Use the Interactive Graph</center></h3>
Pinterest allows you to add up to 4 keywords at a time to compare.
You can add keywords in following ways:

<b>Related Terms</b>: Below the interactive graph are related terms Pinterest auto-suggests. Simply click on they keyword and it will be added to the graph.

<b>Search Bar</b>: Going back up to the search bar, you can type in a new keyword. A list of suggestions based off of what you typed in will pop-up. Once you found the keyword you want, simply click on it to add to the graph.
<br>

<center><h>Keyword Comparision Example </h4></center>
<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/PTKeywordCompare.png" width="80%" height="80%"></center>
<center><i> Using the search bar, I added "cookie decorating" and "royal icing" to the Search Volume Graph</center></i>
<br>
On my Pinterest, I post content related to cake and cookie baking. Being two different topics, I wanted to see if there was a time period where when is more popular than the other.
<br>
<br>
That way, I can plan out my content strategy better. Knowing if cakes are searched more than cookies during a certain time can help me post content related to cakes. 
<br>
<br>
To start off, I added "cake decorating" and "cookie decorating" to the search volume graph. 
<br>
<br>
Around Christmas time, cake decorating stops getting as much searches. What takes it's place? Cookie decorating!
<br>
<br>
Royal icing is a type of frosting that is often used for cookie decorating. Ever see one of those memorizing cookie decorating videos? Yup. They're using royal icing.
<br>
<br>
Knowing that royal icing and cookie decorating goes hand-in-hand, I added "royal icing" to the graph.
<br>
..and I saw that royal icing is by far the highest searched keyword around Christmas! 
<br>
<br>
Now how might I use this information to plan out content?
<br>
<br>
Starting in December, I would start posting content related to royal icing and cookie decorating. Some of my followers may be more interest in cakes than cookies. So to stay relevant to that audience, I would continue to post some content on cakes.
<br>

Launched in December 2019, Pinterest 100 is a visual way to explore what is trending on Pinterest.
The homepage has the top trend themes laid out visually, but to see all of the topics at once you can click the two vertical lines on the top left.
<br>
Pinterest considers a theme a trend if there was a search volume trajectory for at least six months.
The current 2020 report compares August 2017 - July 2018 to August 2018 - July 2019.
<br>
Partnering with WGSN, Pinterest identified keywords surrounding these trends broken down by country.
