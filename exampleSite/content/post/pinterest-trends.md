Panel Breakdown

The Search Volume Dashboard has 3 main sections:

Pinterest takes the search volume for the given keyword and compares it to all other searches on Pinterest on the same day.

Basically, they give you a relative search volume metric and not actual searches per day.

Related Terms: Underneath the graph are related terms that are either similar to your keyword, or what users are also searching for.
By clicking on an additional keyword, you can can compare search volume between keywords.

Popular Pins: On this panel you can see previews of some of the top pins based on the keywords selected. Clicking on the previews takes you to the search results page.
