The [Pinterest Trends](https://trends.pinterest.com/) dashboard includes a search bar where you can search for your own keywords.

Below the search bar is a discovery dashboard. It highlights keywords that had peaks in search volumes within the last year. The suggestions may or may not be relevant to you. 

After clicking on or searching for a keyword, you are taken to the Search Volume Results dashboard. From there you can view a search volume graph, see recommended keywords, and discover content ideas.
