Hashtags
What hashtags could my content show up on? Was there a method to the hashtag madness? These were the types of questions I set out to answer.

Developing Hashtag Bucket System 

When I first started, I used very generic hashtags that had millions of posts associated with them. The problem was that hashtags like #CakeDecorating had hundreds of posts an hour being tagged. Everyone’s content was getting buried. 

[Instagram Bucket Here] 

<center><h3> Instagram Bucketing System </center></h3>
<b><i>Less Than 10K </b></i> -> Micro-hashtags.
<b><i> 10K - 50K </b></i> -> I hypothesized I would rank for these hashtags, as I only had a few thousand followers.
<b><i> 50K - 100K </b></i> -> These hashtags were worth a shot using, but I didn’t expect to actually have my content appear at the top of these.
<b><i> 100K+ </b></i> -> This is obviously a very large bucket. At the time of creating these buckets, I didn’t see a difference between hashtags with 100K posts or 1 million. They both seemed way too large.

My strategy was to choose 2-8 hashtags from each bucket on my posts. 

<center><h3> Why Getting On the Top of the Hashtag Was Critical </center></h3>

<Center><i>#CakesofInstagram top posts on 3/5/2020. This was what was first shown to visitors when they visited the page that day.</center></i>

Being on the top page of a hashtag helps people discover content and new accounts to follow. When someone explores a hashtag, the top content is the first thing people see.

Gaining a spot on the “top” of a hashtag (particularly in the first 6 spots, before the fold) increased both post engagement and the amount of people who followed my account from that post.

. At the time of posting, this cake ranked for the following hashtags:
#RainbowCake | 804K Posts

#ButterCreamFrosting | 231K Posts

#AmazingCake | 215K Posts

Below are the engagement metrics from the Rainbow Cake Post:
<br>
202,943 Reach 
<br>
719 Follows
<br>
1,388 Profile Visits
<br>
12,036 Engagements (Likes, comments, shares + Shaves)
<br>
<br>
Similar cake posts from the same time period received:
 ~1,500 engagements
 <br>
~20,000 Reach
<br>
~15 Follows

<center><h3> Check to See If and How Long Content is Ranking <center></h3>
  
After posting,  I would click on each hashtag I used during the approximate time intervals:
 * ~15 Mins after posting
 * 1 Hour After Posting
 * ~5 Hours After Posting
 * Morning After Posting

Using these intervals, it was easier to see <b><i>if</b></i> content was ranking on the top and <b><i>how long</b></i> it was ranking at the top.

Some interesting “stickiness” patterns emerged:
<br>
<b><u> 15 Minutes </b></u> - If the content was on the top of the hashtag after the first 15 minutes, there was a good chance the content would “stick” for longer.
<br>
On larger hashtags (>100K Posts), this was less certain. Content ranking moved quicker on bigger hashtags.
<br>
<b><u>1 Hour</b></u> - Content ranking on the hashtag after an hour was a good indication of stickiness.
<br>
<b><u>5 Hours</b></u> - This is approximately the time that content started to drop off the top.
<br>
Posts that would stick on the top until the morning after posting were typically on smaller hashtags (<50K posts).
<br>
<b><u>Morning After</b></u> - On larger hashtags, these were the posts that went “viral”. I only had a couple of posts go “viral”. On micro-hashtags (<30K), the content would often stick for days, weeks, or even months. The content may not have gone viral, but the content would still get engagement.
<br>
Viral posts often received 5K+ likes and 500+ followers.
<br>
Sticky content on micro-hashtags would gain ~50 extra likes/followers over time.
  <br>

<h4> Theories on Why Content Sticks </h4>
Engagement within the first 10 - 15 Minutes of a post matters to rank on the top of a hashtag.
<br>
As you rank on the top of a hashtag, the content continues to gain engagement which increases stickiness.
<br>
Instagram may use an engagement:followers ratio to help gauge good content vs just content with large Instagram followings.

<center><h3> When It Comes to Hashtags Size Matters </h3></center>
  After paying attention to which hashtags I was showing up on the top for, I noticed a pattern.

There was a relationship between how many followers my Instagram account had and the type of hashtags my featured posts showed up on the top for.

With only a few thousand followers, my account’s posts would be on the top of hashtags that had less than 50k posts.

As BakersSpotlight started to grow,  my content could no longer rank very well for the smaller hashtags (under 50k posts). Instead I was ranking for hashtags with 51k - 100k posts.

As my Instagram community continued to grow into the 10,000’s, my featured posts started to rank for hashtags that had 100k+ posts. Some posts even started to rank for hashtags that had 1 million posts.

Instagram takes many variables into consideration when it determines which content to rank on the top of hashtags. Follower count and engagement rate are two variables that likely play a major role in content getting ranked.

<center><h3> There are 3 Factors That Make a Hashtag Good </center></h3>
After several months of observing hashtags, I came up with three different factors that make a hashtag worthwhile to use. 

<b> Visibility </b>: The hashtag has a lot of searches/visitors looking up the hashtag
<br>
<b>Rankability</b>: The ability for content to rank on the top page
<br>
<b>Longevity</b>: How long a piece of content could stay on the “Top Hashtag” page.

The best hashtags to use would ideally have high visibility, easy rankability, and ranking longevity. Unfortunately, none of the hashtags I used checked all three.. 

These three factors and hashtag size had a correlation:
<br>
<b>Lower # Of Posts</b>: (10K - 20K posts) had high ranking longevity and high rankability. These hashtags fell short on visibility, however.
<br>
<b>Higher # Of Posts</b>: (100K+), there was often a higher amount of visibility, but it would be more difficult to rank content for AND have that content rank for an extended period of time.
