Hashtags
What hashtags could my content show up on? Was there a method to the hashtag madness? These were the types of questions I set out to answer.

Developing Hashtag Bucket System 

When I first started, I used very generic hashtags that had millions of posts associated with them. The problem was that hashtags like #CakeDecorating had hundreds of posts an hour being tagged. Everyone’s content was getting buried. 

[Instagram Bucket Here]

Less Than 10K -> Micro-hashtags.
10K - 50K -> I hypothesized I would rank for these hashtags, as I only had a few thousand followers.
50K - 100K -> These hashtags were worth a shot using, but I didn’t expect to actually have my content appear at the top of these. 
100K+ -> This is obviously a very large bucket. At the time of creating these buckets, I didn’t see a difference between hashtags with 100K posts or 1 million. They both seemed way too large.

My strategy was to choose 2-8 hashtags from each bucket on my posts.

<Center><i>#CakesofInstagram top posts on 3/5/2020. This was what was first shown to visitors when they visited the page that day.</center></i>

Being on the top page of a hashtag helps people discover content and new accounts to follow. When someone explores a hashtag, the top content is the first thing people see.

Gaining a spot on the “top” of a hashtag (particularly in the first 6 spots, before the fold) increased both post engagement and the amount of people who followed my account from that post.
