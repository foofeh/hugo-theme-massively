A few starting points:

* This way of hashtag research is only available on the Pinterest app.
* Pinterest only allows you to use up to 20 hashtags.
* Creating a spreadsheet of hashtag ideas may be beneficial.

This guide walks through how I find hashtags when featuring bakers for BakersSpotlight.com. Specifically, I will be walking through featuring a Valentine's Day cake.

<center><h3> What Hashtags Will Fit This Cake? </center></h3>

With Valentine's Day around the corner, many people are looking for baking inspiration.

This cheat sheet will be walking though how I would find hashtags for this cake. Made out of buttercream frosting, this is an adorable cake for any Valentine's day party!

<Center><H2> 1. Start With a Generic, Short, and Relevant Word - See What Populates </Center></H2>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/image0%20(1)(1).jpeg" width="50%" height="50%" align="left" style="margin:0px 20px">

When doing hashtag research, I always start with a relevant, generic, and short word. 

Using shorter and generic words allows Pinterest to auto-populate hashtags that have the highest amount of pins associated with it. What is shown in the pop-up is where I get my hashtag ideas from.

\#CakeDecorating and #CakeDecoratingIdeas are the two keywords I thought where most relevant, and clicked them to add to the description.

I usually don't select pins that have millions of content associated with them. I found on Instagram choosing large hashtags made it difficult for my content to get discovered

<Center><H2> 2. Experiment with Longer Keyword Strings </Center></H2>

In the my initial research, there were two hashtags that used Cake Decorating. It seemed to be a topic a decent amount of people where tagging their content as. 

I set out to see if there were any more cake decorating hashtags to be found.

Going back to the description field, I started to type out **#CakeDecor.**Being a longer word, I was surprised that more related hashtags popped up.

If I didn't type in #CakeDecor, I would not have found: #CakeDecoratingTips, #CakeDecoratingDesigns and #CakeDecorator.

Now I always experiment starting with single words and word-strings.

In this example, I knew there were going to be other hashtags I wanted to add. So I added the circled hashtags on the right and moved on.


<Center><H2> 3. Repeat the Process With Other Keywords </Center></H2>

Users may be looking up a variety of keywords that relate to the content I was featuring: How to decorate a cake.

After using several hashtags centered around cake decorating, I started to research another popular baking topic: frosting.

Buttercream is a very popular type of frosting that is used to decorate cakes. Knowing this, I started to type out buttercream to see what would pop up.

The content piece I was sharing was a video using _buttercream_ frosting to decorate a cake. So I used the first three hashtags circled in red.

Since my video did not use flowers or link to a recipe, I did not use the bottom three hashtags.

<Center><H2> 4. Don't Forget About Seasonality!** </Center></H2>

What I have found on both Instagram and Pinterest, is that using seasonal hashtags is important to stay relevant and have engagement.

During a season, holiday, or other important event, I always research seasonal hashtags related to my content.

Every time I post content with a seasonal hashtag, I notice that content gets higher engagement and reaches more people.

The cake decorating video I had was Valentine's Day themed and at the end of January. I looked into what hashtags where relevant.

I started to type in #ValentinesDay, and found a TON of different hashtags related to Valentines Day.

\#ValentinesDay is a very generic hashtag, but I wanted to see how it would perform. #ValentinesDayFood was also relevant to the cake decorating.

Choosing these hashtags can help someone find this pretty heart shape cake video- just in time to try it themselves for Valentine's Day!


<Center><H2> 5. Continually Experiment With New Hashtags and Content </Center></H2>

Once I notice that my content is starting to get discovered and receive more engagement, I continue to use those hashtags. I also try to use similar content that people found engaging in the past.

For example: A video I featured of decorating a cake had a very high level of engagement.

In the future, I may feature a similar video (i.e someone else decorating a cake) with the same hashtags.

I would repeat this process until I start seeing a dip in engagement.

My plan would be to try out a new format and new hashtags. Maybe people are over cakes and want to see cookie decorating videos.

Experimenting has been the way I have built engaged communities. I listen to what my followers are engaging with and react when they don't.
