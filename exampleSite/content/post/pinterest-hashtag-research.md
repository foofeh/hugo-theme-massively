A few starting points:

* This way of hashtag research is only available on the Pinterest app.
* Pinterest only allows you to use up to 20 hashtags on a pin.
* Creating a spreadsheet of hashtag ideas may be beneficial.

With Valentine's Day around the corner, I will be walking through how I found new hashtags for a Valentine's themed cake.

At the end of March, many bakers are looking for Valentine's Day baking inspiration. 
<br>
I would love to for bakers to be able to find this adorable cake during their search. Using hashtags is a perfect way to get this cake in front of them.

<Center><H2> 1. Start With a Generic, Short, and Relevant Word</Center></H2>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/image0%20(1)(1).jpeg" width="50%" height="50%" style="float:left; margin-left:0px; margin-right:20px">
I always start hashtag research with a relevant, generic, and short word.
<br>
<br>
Starting with a smaller word allows Pinterest to auto-populate hashtags. What pops up first are hashtags that have the most pins associated with them.
The auto-suggest is where I get my hashtag ideas from.
<br>
<br>
In this example, I started typing out <b>#Cake</b> to see what would pop-up.
<br>
<br>
<b>#CakeDecorating</b> & <b>#CakeDecoratingIdeas</b> are the two keywords I thought where most relevant; I added them to the description.
<br>
<br>
<Center><H2>2. Experiment with Longer Keyword Strings </H2> </Center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/image1(1).jpeg" width="50%" height="50%" align="right" style="text-align:left; margin:0px 20px; padding: 10px">
In my initial research, there were two hashtags that used "Cake Decorating" at the start. 
<br>
<br>
This gave me the idea to use "Cake Decorating" as a stepping stone. My goal was to see if I could find any other hashtags that started with "cake decorating".
</p>
Going back to the description field, I started to type out <b>#CakeDecor</b>. Being a longer word, I was surprised that more related hashtags popped up.
</p>
If I didn't type in <b>#CakeDecor </b>, I would not have found: <b>#CakeDecoratingTips</b>, <b>#CakeDecoratingDesigns</b> and <b>#CakeDecorator</b>.
<p>
Now I always experiment starting with single words and word-strings.
<p>
In this example, I knew there were going to be other hashtags I wanted to add. I continued on to the next step of hashtag research.
</p>



<Center><H2> 3. Repeat the Process With Other Keywords </Center></H2>

When someone wants to search for cake decorating content, there are a lot of relevant hashtags.

Several of my hashtags where focused on cake decorating. I wanted to diversify my hashtags to be relevant to more people's searches. Another popular baking topic came to mind: frosting.

The content piece I was sharing used buttercream frosting.

Buttercream is a type of frosting that is commonly used to decorate cakes. I started to type out "buttercream" to see what hashtags would pop up.
<p>
Circled in red where the most relevant hashtags that I added to my pin.
 
<Center><H2> 4. Don't Forget About Seasonality!</Center></H2>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foofeh/hugo-theme-massively/master/exampleSite/static/uploads/image0%20(3)(1).jpeg" width="45%" height="45%" align="right" style="margin:0px 20px">
What I have found on social media is that using seasonal hashtags are important to stay relevant and engaging.

During a holiday, I always research seasonal hashtags related to my content.

Every time I post content with a seasonal hashtag, I notice that post gets higher engagement and reaches more people.

Being a Valentine's Day cake, I typed in <b>#ValentinesDay</b> to see what would pop-up.

I added the generic <b>#ValentinesDay</b> as a performance test. I wanted to see how it would perform. <b>#ValentinesDayFood</b> was also relevant, so I added that as well.

Choosing these hashtags can help someone find this pretty heart shape cake video- just in time to try it themselves for Valentine's Day!


<Center><H2> 5. Continually Experiment With New Hashtags and Content </Center></H2>
When a post performs well, I try to replicate the results. My future posts will consistent of similar content and the same hashtags. Occassionally, I will also experiment with new hashtags and new content. 

It's a balancing act of experimenting with new content and sticking to what people currently like.

Experimenting has been the way I have built engaged communities. I continue to provide the content that my followers are engaging with while also experimenting with new content.
